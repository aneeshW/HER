            Hey Aditi,<br><br>
            I honestly never thought I'll fall for someone so easily , like in the beginning phase itself <br>
            maybe I was a bit of a jerk in the start, but I'll change myself for you, and I certainly will thats my promise to you <br>
            If I were to describe the day we met, it was ETHEREAL , and you like whoa why and how are you so beautiful ??? <br>
            Ever since I lay my eyes on you nothing else seems to matter to me, except you, I could stare at your eyes forever <br>
            I can promise you that I'll give you everything 
            you ever wanted, <br> but I can't say it will happen, but one thing I can certainly say is I'll do whatever to make it happen, <br>
            and as Rumi once said 
            If there are a thousand lovers, I am one of them. <br>
            If there are a hundred lovers, I am one of them. <br>
            If there is one lover, that is me. <br>
            If there are no lovers, that means I am no longer alive <br>
            And I, Aneesh, am saying this in every sense of the words—that I love you, Aditi. <br>
            I mean it completely, honestly, and without hesitation.
            <br>
            <br>
            Yours truly <br>
            Aneesh Walikar
            🌷
